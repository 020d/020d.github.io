	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I have a background in system administration and programming.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The first time I saw code vulnerable to SQL Injection an alarm went off in my head.</p>
        <p>Immediately I could see the problem, the user name was being put right into the SQL query. Anything the user typed in would run as part of the SQL command.</p>
        <p>A little piece of trivia came to me, I'd heard of this before. <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/">Bobby Tables</a>. As I hadn't worked with server side languages before security wasn't an issue. This however was a whole new world and I needed to get up to speed... and <em>fast</em>.</p>
        <p>From there I found OWASP and was hooked.</p>
        <p>Instead of just fixing the web app flaws I learned about and moving on, I kept digging and digging.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>This is my journey from Zero... to zero day.</p>
	<p>
	<p>In this blog I don't want to just do "look what I did!" posts, I want to touch on core security and coding concepts whenever I can. That way the information will be accessible to a wide range of readers.
